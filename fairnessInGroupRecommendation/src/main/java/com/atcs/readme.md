Motivated by the sequential methods we discussed in class, the goal of the third
assignment is to design and implement a new method for producing sequential group
recommendations.
Also, provide detailed explanations and clarifications about why the
method you propose works well for the case of sequential group recommendations.

Hint: There is no need to design a method from scratch. For the needs of this assignment,
you can suggest simple modifications of the existing approach, e.g., by proposing and
using alternatives for group aggregation that ensure good results for the group.

Produce a group of 3 users, and for this group, show the top-10 recommendations in 3
different sequences, i.e., the 10 movies with the highest prediction scores in 3 rounds,
using the MovieLens 100K rating dataset.

Any programming language for your assignment is acceptable. Please explain any
assumptions you made.
The assignment may be completed in pairs. Both students are expected to understand,
be able to explain, and be able to modify the implementation.
